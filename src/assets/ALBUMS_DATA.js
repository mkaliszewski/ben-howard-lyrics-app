[Verse 1]
Hot sand on toes, cold sand in sleeping bags
I've come to know that memories were the best things you ever had
The summer shone, beat down on bony backs
So far from home, where the ocean stood down dust and pinecone tracks
We slept like dogs down by the fire side
Awoke to the fog where all around us, the boom of summer time, yeah...
[Chorus 1]
We stood
Steady as the stars in the woods
So happy-hearted, and the warmth
Rang true inside these bones
As the old pine fell, we sang
Just to bless the morning...
[Verse 2]
Hot sand on toes, cold sand in sleeping bags
I've come to know the friends around you are all you'll always have
Smoke in my lungs, or the echoed stone
Careless and young, free as the birds that fly with weightless souls, now
[Chorus 2]
We stood
Steady as the stars in the woods
So happy-hearted, and the warmth
Rang true inside these bones
We stood
Steady as the stars in the woods
So happy-hearted, and the warmth
Rang true inside these bones
As the old pine fell, we sang
Just to bless the morning...
[Refrain]
We grow, grow, steady as the morning
Yeah, we grow, grow, older still
Ah, we grow, grow, happy as a new dawn
We grow, grow, older still
Ah, we grow, grow, steady as the flowers
Yeah, we grow, grow, older still
Ah, we grow, grow, happy as a new dawn
We grow, grow, older still...`

[Verse 1]
All I am is the bones you made for me
So garishly clean
White as the horses
That carry me away...
All my demons, you said, come and go with the days
A mind's will to play
I grow old in my way
Oh, just like you do...
[Chorus 1]
Oh, there ain't no diamonds in the boredom
Oh, there ain't no darkness that I fear
Oh, there ain't no way to say I love you more, no
So be clear, just to be clear
So be clear, be clear...
[Verse 2]
All I am is the bones you made for me
Just driftwood for the sea
Heavy as the horses
That carry me away...
Mm, ah, that carry me away!
[Chorus 2]
Oh, there ain't no diamonds in the boredom
No, there ain't no darkness that I fear
Oh, there ain't no way to say I love you more, no
So be clear, be clear
[Chorus 3]
Oh, there ain't no diamonds in the boredom
Oh-oh-oh, no darkness that I fear
Oh-oh oh, no way to say I love you more, oh
So be clear, just to be clear

Falling from high places
Falling through lost spaces
Now that we're lonely
Now that there's nowhere to go
Watching from both sides
These clock towers burning up
I lost my time here, oh
I lost my patience with it all
And we lost faith, oh in the arms of love

Where you been hiding lately?
Where you been from hiding from the news?
(Oh, hiding lately

Because we've been fighting lately
We've been fighting with the wolves

Fighting with the wolves)
Ooh

Red tongues and hands...

Oh, falling from high places

[Verse 1]
And the birds still
Sing outside these
These windows
Where we sat together
Like nothing ever
Happened here, oh
Oh, the white house on the hill
Black clouds the weather
[Verse 2]
And the church spire
Over the river
She still sits there, warm
In the evening glow
But you don't care about
All these scenes I treasure
Well, these west winds
I know, I know
[Bridge 1]
Seems everything around here
Stays like stone
Seems it's about time, darling
About time we let this all go
[Chorus]
'Cause everything
Will start again anew
'Cause everything
Just goes that way, my friend
And every king
Knows it to be true
That every kingdom
Must one day come to an...
E-e-end
E-e-end, oh
E-e-end
E-e-end, mm, mm...
[Verse 3]
And the sun
She may be long gone
O lost, to these memories
We found
But she'll be here
When it's all done
When our bodies are lain
Beneath the ground
[Bridge 2]
Seems everything that goes around
Comes, comes around here
Seems everything that stays here
Somehow, gets me down again
[Chorus]
Mm, everything
Must start again anew
'Cause everything
Just goes that way, my friend
And every king
Knows it to be true
That every kingdom
Must one day come to an...

Tell me how you feel
Just a blade in the grass
A spoke unto the wheel

Tell me where it's all gone

Those arms that held you strong

I've been worryin'
That my time here's a little unclear
I've been worryin'
That I'm losing the ones I hold dear
I've been worryin'

Live our lives
In the confines of fear

Just a grain in the morning air
Dark shadow on the hill

Will make a fool of us all

[Verse 1]
I spent my time watchin'
The spaces that have grown between us
And I cut my mind on second best
Or the scars that come with the greenness
And I gave my eyes to the bottom
Still the seabed wouldn't let me in
And I tried my best
To embrace the darkness in which I swim
[Verse 2]
I'm walkin' back down this mountain
With the strength of a turnin' tide
Oh the wind's so soft and my skin
And the sun so hard upon my side
Oh lookin' out at this happiness
I search for between the sheets
Oh, feelin' blind and realize
All I was searchin' for was me
Oh, oh-oh, all I was searchin' for was me...
[Chorus]
Keep your head up, keep your heart strong
No, no, no, no
Keep your mind set, keep your hair long
Oh my, my darlin'
Keep your head up, keep your heart strong
No, no, no, no
Keep your mind set in your ways
And keep your heart strong
[Verse 3]
I saw a friend of mine the other day
And he told me that my eyes were gleamin'
Oh, I said I had been away
And he knew, oh, he knew the depths I was meanin'
And it felt so good to see his face
All the comfort invested in my soul
Oh, to feel the warmth of a smile
When he said, "I'm happy to have you home
Oh, oh-oh, I'm happy to have you home"
[Chorus]
Keep your head up, keep your heart strong
No, no, no, no
Keep your mind set, keep your hair long
Oh my, my darlin'
Keep your head up, keep your heart strong
No, no, no, no
Keep your mind set in your ways
And keep your heart strong

'Cause I'll always remember you the same
Oh, eyes like wild flowers, oh, with your demons of change...

May you find happiness there (Keep your head up, keep your heart strong)
(Keep your head up, keep your heart strong)

No, no, no, no (Keep your head up, keep your heart strong)

`[Verse 1]
Black flies on the windowsill
That we are
That we are
That we are to know
Winter stole summer's thrill
And the river's cracked and cold
See the sky is no man's land
A darkened plume to stay
Hope here needs a humble hand
Not a fox found in your place
[Chorus]
And no man is an island, oh this I know
But can't you see, oh?
Maybe you were the ocean, when I was just a stone

Black flies on the windowsill
That we are
That we are
That we are to hold
Comfort came against my will
And every story must grow old
Still I'll be a traveler
A gypsy's reins to face
But the road is wearier
With that fool found in your place
[Chorus]
And no man is an island, oh this I know
But can't you see, oh?
Maybe you were the ocean, when I was just a stone
And no man is an island, oh this I know
But can't you see, oh?

So here we are

And I don't wanna beg your pardon
And I don't wanna ask you why
But if I was to go my own way
Would I have to pass you by?
And I don't wanna beg your pardon

That's alright with me
Oh you love him with all of your body
That's alright honey
That's alright with me
Oh you love him like he'll be there for always
Always honey yeah, always near
Always honey, always near
Always honey, always near
Oh go far from this small town bar we know
Oh go, leave me with this burning soul
Out here in the cold
Cause it's just the bones you're made of`

I saw you earlier on
They were playing blues downtown
Some kind of Mississippi, Mississippi song
And I know, I know, I know I caught your eye
Because you darling, you caught mine
So lady get down
Like there's no-one else around here
Baby, move like you wanna
Baby, move like you need
Honey, move like you ought to
Baby, move just to please me
Baby, move like you wanna
Baby, move like you need
Oh I saw you, watching the band play slow
Eyes like a morning star
In the soft of the early evening glow
And I know, I know, I know you were burning up inside
Because these feelings, these feelings are so hard to hide
So woman get down
Like there's no-one else around here
Baby, move like you wanna

Oh my mind!
I walk down Mayflower Road again
The wailing sun
Echoes from the park seem so absurd
The bus takes hours
I knew it would
But I can't shake the sting
Can't spend my time
On everybody else
If buildings fell
At least we'd be in matrimony
I can't control
The words kaleidoscope inside my head
[Chorus]
Has the world gone mad
Or is it me?
All these small things they gather round me
Gather round me
Is it all so very bad?
I can't see
All these small things they gather round me
Gather round me
[Verse 2]
I saw the police
Screaming something trivial
Like 'keep the peace!'
The world moves on and you can't shake the sound
I know she's home
Waiting on somebody
Loathe in light
All in my mind
The anvil and the weight upon my back
[Chorus] x2
Has the world gone mad
Or is it me?
All these small things they gather round me
Gather round me
Is it all so very bad?
I can't see
All these small things they gather round me
Gather around me
And I can't see my love
Has the world gone mad or is it me?
All these small things they gather round me, gather round me
Is it all so very bad? I can't see...
All these small things they gather round me, gather around me
And I can't see my love

[Verse 1]
Hold it in, the river in your mouth is pouring out
Water takes the shape of all that it surrounds
Yeah I know, I've been trying too hard
To keep in time with all of the hours in your day
[Verse 2]
Hold it in, they wouldn't let you out among the crowd
Not like that these streets will tear you down
How it is, under my skin
Now you are, pictures of all you'll ever be
[Chorus]
I am not myself today
I am not feeling okay
[Verse 3]
Hold it in, the river in your mouth is pouring out
Water takes the shape of all that it surrounds
Yeah I know, I've been trying so hard
To keep in time, with all of the sounds that you make
[Verse 4]
Hold it in they come at you from both sides of your mind
Thick and thin; these walls you'll always stand behind
I'm sick and tired, oh I begged for the world to change
But it don't, it ain't all you and that's the thing
[Chorus]
I am not myself today
I am not feeling okay
[Bridge]
And you showed me hope amidst the harlequins in spring
And you told me life was learning how to be your friend`

[Verse 1]
Hey, I wasn't listening
I was watching Syria
Blinded by the sunshine strip
And you, you were in the kitchen
Oh your mariner's mouth
The wounded with the wounder's whip
[Bridge 1]
And that's how summer passed
The great dividing range
The green, green grass
And oh, maybe it was peace at last, who knew
[Chorus]
Then, hello love
My invincible friend
Hello love
The thistle and the burr
Hello love
For you I have so many words
But I, I forget where we were
[Verse 2]
Hey, I wasn't listening
I was stung by all of us
The blind leading out the bored
And as per usual
You were skipping and laughing
Eyes at the bedroom door
"Don't take it so seriously, only time is ours, the rest we'll just wait and see!'
Maybe you're right babe
Maybe
[Bridge 2]
That's how summer passed: the great dividing range, the green, green, grass
And oh maybe I'll hold on fast
To you
[Chorus]
Then, hello love
My invincible friend
Hello love
The thistle and the burr
Hello love
For you I have so many words
But I, I forget where we were
I, I forget where we were
I, I forget where we were
I forget where we were, no
I forget where we were, no

That's how summer passed: the great dividing range, the green, green, grass

[Verse 1]
Always a riddle in the world she said
Always a riddle inside my head
Always a thing of wonder
The way we come to be
Oh it's a big old place for me
Yeah it's a big old world indeed
Everyone is killing me and everything conspires
[Chorus]
In dreams I have watched it spin
Seen the violent crack of atoms
Where all light comes in
In dreams I have lain in sin
Just to be the cracked and the cared for
[Bridge]
How can I ask, ask for more?
[Verse 2]
Always a riddle in the world she says
Always a riddle inside my head
Always a thing of wonder
The way we come to be
Oh it's a big old place for me
Yeah it's a big old world indeed
Been kicking my heels and wondering how I've been here so long
[Chorus]
In dreams I have watched it spin
See a violent crack of atoms
Where all light comes in
In dreams I saw Aesop's kin
Just a carcass of a man now alone inside his skin
[Bridge]
Where to, where to begin?

I live alone
I live alone in life without you
I may be troubled
But I'm gracious in defeat
Oh I may be troubled but
I'm gracious in defeat`

[Verse 1]
Seen fortune in my lifetime
Gave it all to the man instead
Still tomorrow comes, I'm still standing on my own two feet
Got a woman at home
She treats me well

Anger, I seen it rise
From a careless word that I said
Well guilt is wasteful, pride is childish
Got a woman at home
She told me that
Got a woman at home
She taught me well
[Verse 3]
Found sorrow in my mind most times
Gave it all back to the life I led
Well since times change, it all just rolls away
Now I've got a woman at home
She treats me well

She's alright
When everyone is wrong
She's alright
Lets me waste another song
Stumble through the years
I'll make it heaven, make it hell
One day to the next for now it serves me very well
Now I've got a woman at home
She treats me well
[Verse 4]
Mourning, I've done my time here
Stood here watching my own death
Well a few things going my way this time
Got a woman at home
She treats me well
[Verse 5]
Slumber, not in my lifetime
Won't spend my days in my bed
Make the whole scene gather round come see it my way
Now I got a woman at home
She treats me well

She's alright
When everyone is wrong
She's alright
Lets me waste another song

[Verse 1]
Wrapped up in dissonance
I'm sorry that I just walked away
Lost in the insignificance of mine
I had no words to say
Now I am better
I implore you to say it isn't right
But somewhere deep in history
Your father pulled the teeth out of your fight
[Chorus]
Hold it in, let's go dancing
I do believe we're only passing through
Wired again, look who's laughing
You again, all you, all you, all you
Hold it in, let's go dancing
I do believe we're only passing through
Wired again, look who's laughing
Me again, all fired up on you
[Bridge]
And now she's caught between
What to say and what she really means
[Verse 2]
Wrapped up in empathy
The chemicals are pushing past my blood
Hold all my cliches
They are tipping my tongue to tell you that it's love
[Chorus]
Hold it in, let's go dancing
I do believe we're only passing through
Wired again, look who's laughing
You again, all you, all you, all you
Hold it in, let's go dancing
I do believe we're only passing through
Wired again now look who's laughing
Me again, all fired up on you
[Bridge]
And now she's caught between
What to say and what she really means
And I am finally coloring
Inside the lines that I live between

Wired again, look who's laughing
You again, all you, all you, all you
Hold it in, let's go dancing
I do believe we're only passing through
Wired again, look who's laughing
Me again, all fired up on you
Hold it in, let's go dancing
I do believe we're only passing through
Wired again, look who's laughing
You again, all you, all you, all you
Hold it in, let's go dancing
I do believe we're only passing through
Wired again, look who's laughing

Christmas flared amongst us
And we called it evergreen
Built a world without your love

But I can't remember what

[Verse 1]
Door is locked, my gums are bleeding
Outside she reads, outside she is reading
The evacuation procedure
Out loud
Clothes are off, my health receding
Somewhere she dreams, somewhere she is dreaming
Of Caribbean Nica Libres
At dusk
[Chorus 1]
While the faithful dispose of a generation
And all of the mountains whisper knowingly
I order a colada and sit to count my dollars
And watch eagles soar in circles
Perpetually

Forever, forever
Such a beautiful thing
[Chorus 2]
Now I am older, I don't look over my shoulder
I know what is there in front of me
Ten Marlboro cigarettes I've rolled the butts into the bottle tops
Today I will stare at the sea
Till my eyes have had enough

[Verse 1]
Towing the line
I watched the host drink all the wine
And now she rambles
Through the who's and who have not's
The old man is a painter
Of tired sea scapes
Tilted adventures
And so my mind wanders
Picking at the table to cure the rot
Like a bird in a world with no trees
You were hung up there in your disbelief
I know I'm a hard rock to drag around
[Chorus]
Love is in the early mornings
In the shadows under the trees
Not in the cuckolded ashes floating down from the rookery
Down here I'll crow for you, you crow for me
Down here I'll crow for you, you crow for me
[Verse 2]
Towing the line
I watched the host drink all the wine
And now I’m purring
For a drop of anything
Throwing stones at your window
You turn to me as if it’s simple
Why can’t you be like the blackbird
And sing
I say I’m the westerlies in Ireland
So decadent and violent
Can’t you see I’m a forager
Clawing at the bedrock
[Chorus]
Love is in the early mornings
In the shadows under the trees
Not in the cuckolded ashes
Floating down from the rookery
Down here I'll crow for you, you crow for me
Down here I'll crow for you, you crow for me`

[Verse 1]
To care
Or not to care
To be there
In the distant and uncertain
To be aware
In an old Iberian hotel room
That the devil
Is not behind the curtain
She said walk in small steps
And fear floating
We made a pact
As Saturn approaching
Leaned on the sky
And smoking a cigarette
Said it's late
You should be going
The wind is howling
The house is showing
High numbers
[Chorus]
Boat to an island on the wall
Hand striking in slow motion
Future
Singing in a field
Shooting season's open
[Verse 2]
To care
Or not care
To be aware
That in your absence
They made your choices for you
You were supposed to laugh
Said the fortune to his sailor
This is the black mountain path
Or these are the sunny shores to nowhere
Well
[Chorus]
Boat to an island on the wall
A hand striking in slow motion
Future singing in a field
Shooting season's open
Boat to an island on the wall
A hand striking in slow motion
That's it, that's it all
Shooting season's open`

Oh Anne Marie
With your chain
Come to me
Make me sane
Feed the dog
Walk a mile
Speak it simple

Tell me your thoughts
Tell me beautiful things

In a wild wood creek
Am I making history?
Am I workin out?
Only what the moon does
To the devout

And I may be floating through memory
We may be the broken wings on a butterfly
But didn't we dream big
Once

You didn't have to tell me
I knew it always
[Outro]
Oh Anne Marie
With your chain
Come to me
Make me sane
Feed the dog
Walk a mile
Most things now make me smile
Am I making history?
Am I working out?
Only what the moon does
To the devout`

[Verse 1]
Go find
Someone else
I am not ready to die
Go whisper softly
To someone else
Ask them
To lie
Down
[Pre-Chorus]
You can tell them I'll be back in a minute
Oh now is not the time
I was there already I think
As a child
But I really can't remember why
[Chorus]
Someone in the doorway
Someone in the light
Someone through the wall always
Someone left outside
[Verse 2]
Go find
Someone else
I am not ready to decide
Go whisper softly
To the man with no time
Ask him to pick sides
[Pre-Chorus]
Tell them I'll be back in a minute
Oh now is not the time
Gone to find the root they all chewed on
For millennia
Do something better with my time
[Chorus]
Someone in the doorway
Someone in the light
Someone in my hallway
Someone wearing a new hat
Someone on the floor outside
They say you don't come back from that
[Outro]
Into the light of a bad dream
Into the laughter of a war
England the sedative on my tongue
Goodbye
Goodbye
That's all
Goodbye
Goodbye
That's all`

All down the mines
All down the mines
All down the mines
All down the mines
I'll keep digging till it's hollowed out inside
Ain't nothing in this world that ain't for me and you

All down the mines
All down the mines
All down the mines

Ain't nothing in this world that ain't for me and you and ours and theirs and his and hers and yours and mine`

[Verse 1]
There is no rush when you don't belong
Turns out we don't all
Fight like dogs in the end
Most of us want to roll out
Roll under the grass
You are limbless, cartoon
No bridge in your song
Spirulina won't cure my heartbreak
I was a dreamer when I learned to take
In between her and the fireplace
There are factors that conditioned me Something in the canopy
Clearly
[Verse 2]
And the blank ones
Cartwheel out of the furnace
The mould never cracked you see
The girls in St Denis
Still sleep on their backs
Understood a fact
When you spoke in all your marvelous ideologies
The world is always at ease
At ease
At ease
Don't you see
[Verse 3]
And the deaths on the highways
From drinking at casinos
Feel so natural
Every day a dice roll
Every way you gamble
Where is something I can handle?
And the world void of Petrov, our savior
We are taught to savour
Everyone else's failures
Endlessly
[Verse 4]
Even the greatest
The very very greatest
Gave up
Tapped out
Told all you fuckers to lie down
Yet still you found
Cathedrals of dissent
Where does the robber go
Where does the robber go to repent?
Tell
Me
[Verse 5]
Till there you were
You wouldn't buy a round
For your best friend
See, it's trickled down
On you I don't depend
There you go then bye
Another end
Bye
Infinitum bye
There you go then
Bye
With such a heavy sound
[Verse 6]
There is no rush when you don't belong
Turns out we don't all fight like dogs in the end
Most of us want to roll out
Roll under the grass
You're limbless, cartoon
No bridge in your song
[Outro]
Make me wonder
Again
Or make me learn
To pretend
Make me wonder
Again
Or make me learn
To pretend
Make me wonder
Again
Or make me learn
To pretend`

[Album Version]
And I said to me
I would like to be
Someone
Kind over cavalier
What have I done with my years?
[Live Version]
Well I walked out Sunday morning
To watch the weather blow through the trees
It’s so nice to be around you now
Fill the days with aching breeze
Put a rose upon my table, dear
Put a leaf inside my door
It’s so nice to be around you now
Fill the days with asking more
And I said to me
I would like to be
Someone
Kind over cavalier
What have I done with my years?`

[Verse 1]
There's your man
He's far from brilliant
See him walk out the door
With lowered head and great resilience
See how he always wants to be around you
See how he always wants to be around you
See him how always wants to be around
[Chorus]
So that's how we live
With lavender and no affection
That's how we talk
With lavender and no affection
It's all talk
It's all talk
These days
No affection
[Verse 2]
There's your man
Staggering on
See him walk out the door
With lowered head time ticking on
See how he always wants to be around you
See how he always wants to be around you
See him how he always wants to be around you
Can't stand the way they talk of one another
Can't stand the way they talk about
One another
Can't stand the way they talk
[Chorus]
So that's how we live
With lavender and no affection
That's how we'll talk
With lavender and no affection
That's how I'll dream with lavender and no affection
That's how I'll dream lavender and no affection
That's how I dream
There's your man
There's your man
There's your man
Darling, there's your man`

[Verse 1]
I asked my neighbor what time is it
Time you know you can't get it back
What's a man anyhow
If not alone
Collecting facts
[Chorus 1]
Well I am love through sickness
Today I am courage at the track
It's so peaceful here
No one to fuck it up
I could lay here for hours
And hours
Not ask you for much
[Verse 2]
Married to the sunshine in my mind
I was floating away
I can see all the flowers in full bloom
I wish I could last and stay
Oh well, living in the darkest hour
[Verse 3]
I am the fortress at Nazaré
Way above the raging sound
Somebody came by to say hi!
And we washed the day down
[Verse 4]
I missed the end of the world
And that was just fine
Saw my family for the holidays
And we had a good time
I am the gentle days end
After all that noise
I am the bull that stood and stared
After the cavalry arrived
I am the perfume memory
Sweetness in her smile
I could lay here for hours and hours
Or I could lay here for a while
I asked my neighbour what time is it?
Time you know, you can't get it back
Why we all so miserable?
Oh, that's right
Nobody ever comes back
[Chorus 2]
Well I am love through sickness
Today I am courage at the track
I'm the hand that feeds you
I'm the hallowed road back home
Oh well, living in the darkest hour
Oh well, living in the darkest hour
It's so peaceful here no one to fuck it up
I could see through miles, miles`
